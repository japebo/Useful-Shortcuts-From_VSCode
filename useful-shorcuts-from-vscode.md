# Useful shorcuts from VS Code

1. **Shift + Alt + Up/Down Arrow Key** copies the line over which we are before or after the line
2. **Alt + Up/Down Arrow Key** moves the line over which we are up/down
3. **Control + Alt + Up/Down Arrow Key** inserts one more cursor each time we press Up/Down arrow key either above or below the current cursor. This way we can perform multiple changes simultaneously.
4. Multiple simultaneous changes in all the ocurrences of a pattern (or word): 
    1. Select the pattern (or word)
	2. **Ctrl + F**
	3. **Alt + ENTER**
	4. Move through the pattern to where you want the cursor to be
5. **F2** renames an element usually works as a faster alternative to the previous tip. 
6. **Ctrl + L** selects current line. If we press L more times successive lines will be selected.
7. **Ctrl + Shift + K** deletes current line
8. **Ctrl + D** to select the word we are currently in and highlight other occurrences of the same word. If we press D more times other cursors appears in the other occurences of the word.
9. **Ctrl + G** to go to a line indicating the line number. 
10. **Ctrl + P** open the command palette. There we can view and navigate to the different files that make up our project; execute vscode commands or commands added to it by a vscode extension (first we need to write >); navigate through the symbols of the current file after typing @ before the symbol name; search through the symbols in the whole project prepending # to the symbol name; and go to a certain line prepending : to the line number.
11. **Ctrl + Shift + F** allows to make a global search through the whole project (any file inside any folder of the project).
12. **Right Click** over a symbol **+** **Find All References** allows us to see all the references to that symbol.

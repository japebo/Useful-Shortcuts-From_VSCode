# Useful shorcuts from VS Code

1. **Shift + Alt + Up/Down Arrow Key** copies the line over which we are before or after the line
2. **Alt + Up/Down Arrow Key** moves the line over which we are up/down
3. **Control + Alt + Up/Down Arrow Key** inserts one more cursor each time we press Up/Down arrow key either above or below the current cursor. This way we can perform multiple changes simultaneously.
4. Multiple simultaneous changes in all the ocurrences of a pattern (or word): 
    1. Select the pattern (or word)
	2. **Ctrl + F**
	3. **Alt + ENTER**
	4. Move through the pattern to where you want the cursor to be
5. **F2** renames an element usually works as a faster alternative to the previous tip. 
6. **Ctrl + L** selects current line. If we press L more times successive lines will be selected.
7. **Ctrl + Shift + K** deletes current line
